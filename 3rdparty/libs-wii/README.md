This directory contains third-party libraries used by the Nintendo Wii version MTek-GDL. zlib, png and tremor may have been modified to run properly on the Wii as it runs on big-endian PowerPC architecture. The libraries included within this library are not meant to be used anywhere else other than with MTek-GDL. Instead, acquire the original sources of the libraries from their official websites.

All the licenses of the aforementioned libraries are not modified in any way.
